# Lit Qomponent Test
- this would be in an actual structured file directory.
As opposed to a file... but I want to see if what it's going to take to get the separate pieces to commect.

Pull in and display the content from: `../../../qore/_qomponents/atomic/1.atoms/button.ts`

```html preview
<style>
    .mars {
      --planet-color: red;
    }
  </style>
<my-element></my-element>
<hr />
<my-element class="mars" planet="Mars"></my-element>
```
