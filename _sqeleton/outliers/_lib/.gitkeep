All of these will be replaced by gitmodules contained within the knowledgebase

These are not contained within the sqaffold but are [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitsubmodules) that should link to dq knowledgebase repos

The library will be ever ongoing so accepting the story for now because we have the Knowledge base folder primed and ready to e symlinked when time.

---

- have the git submodules for all things outside of local dev.
- but symlinking to the local folder may make actual development nicer? 🤷‍♂️ (we'll find out)
  - `../../../../downquark.ventureCore.KnowledgeBase/_lib_modules/.gitkeep`

While not imperative, these are a good place to start for some useful scripts.
