Whisper and Swarm are currently deprecated in web3.js and will not be included in teh template
- https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

This may be worth integrating if needed before `Bee` (above link) is available
- https://erebos.js.org/docs/introduction

And there are deprecated demo scripts in the `web3js-plugin-validation.html` in this directory that may work as well.

The **eth** library in `web3.js` seems to be valid and working examples are shown in the `web3js-plugin-validation.html` in this directory.
The **utils** library in `web3.js` seems to be valid and documentation can be found [here](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-utils.html).
