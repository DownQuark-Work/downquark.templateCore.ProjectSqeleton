# overwrites

## shame.scss
> The idea of shame.css is that you have a totally new stylesheet reserved just for your hacky code.
The code you _have_ to write to get the release out on time, but the code that makes you ashamed.

Allows for:
- You make them stick out like a sore thumb
- You keep your 'main' codebase clean
- You make developers aware that their hacks are made very visible
- You make them easier to isolate and fix.
- `$ git blame shame.css`
