# Base

The `base/` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. In there, you might find some typographic rules, and probably a stylesheet (that Iâ€™m used to calling `_base.scss`), defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements.

## Tokens
The `tokens/` directory will be populated by the `Design Tokens` script. There should be no need to edit _anything_ within that folder.
