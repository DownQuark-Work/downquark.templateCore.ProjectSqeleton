# Templates

The `templates/` folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application. This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the site (header, footer, navigation, sidebarâ€¦), the grid system or even CSS styles for all the forms.

> NOTE: This is named `layout` within the 7-1 Pattern but has been renamed `templates` to match the best practices of React's naming conventions

> NOTE: to follow the best practices of react each component will import their individual template. `_common.scss` is reserved for shared styles between all templates.
