# [The 7-1 Pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern)

The 7-1 pattern: 7 folders, 1 file. Basically, you have all your partials stuffed into 7 different folders, and a single file at the root level (usually named main.scss) which imports them all to be compiled into a CSS stylesheet.

> NOTE: `layout` and `pages` have been renamed to `templates` and `screens` to match the best practices of the Atomic Design Pattern
